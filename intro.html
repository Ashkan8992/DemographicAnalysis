     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p> This site was created as a group project for our Scientific Visualization class in Fall 2016.</p>

     <p> The purpose of this site is to analyze demographic analysis across the United States based on various
         attributes that are selected by the user. These range from age, sex, education, and race. </p>

    <p> The reason that this type of visualization is important is that it can be used to understand
        cultural differences between areas, and can also be used for marketing reasons for target demographics.
        This can lead to better spending of advertising revenue while being able to visualize where it will be
        spent. As this is a chart for different years, it can also be used to show how population demographics in
        certain states and counties has changed over time. The data ranges from 2010 through 2015. </p>

    <h3>About the data</h3>

    <p>The data was downloaded from the US Census Bureau for their <a target="_blank" href="http://factfinder.census.gov/">American Community Survey</a>. </p>

    <div class="quote"><p id="quote_acs">
      The American Community Survey helps local officials, community leaders and businesses understand
      the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed information
      about the American people and workforce.
